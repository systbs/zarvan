# Zarvan: A Linear-Complexity Sequence Model
Zarvan is an innovative PyTorch-based sequence modeling architecture designed for high performance and efficiency, particularly for tasks involving long sequences where traditional quadratic-complexity attention mechanisms (like those in standard Transformers) become computationally expensive. Zarvan achieves competitive results on various sequence-based tasks, including vision and language, by employing a novel linear-complexity selective copy mechanism.

## Key Features
Linear Complexity: Unlike standard Transformers, Zarvan's computational complexity scales linearly with sequence length, making it highly efficient for very long sequences.

Selective Copy Mechanism: The core ZarvanBlock incorporates a gating mechanism that allows the model to dynamically "copy" or "filter" information from the input sequence based on a global query and interactive context. This enables efficient information flow without explicit element-wise attention.

Modular Design: The architecture is broken down into reusable and understandable modules (SinusoidalPositionalEncoding, LinearQueryExtractor, ZarvanBlock).

PyTorch Implementation: Fully implemented in PyTorch, leveraging its flexibility and performance.

Versatile: Designed to be applicable across various sequence modeling tasks, including classification, retrieval, and potentially generation.

## Architecture Overview
The Zarvan architecture consists of the following main components:

SinusoidalPositionalEncoding: Adds positional information to input embeddings, allowing the model to account for the order of elements in a sequence. This is a standard component inspired by the original Transformer.

LinearQueryExtractor: An efficient module that processes the entire input sequence to generate a single "global query" vector. This query summarizes the sequence's content and is used to guide the selective copy mechanism in the ZarvanBlock. It operates with linear complexity.

ZarvanBlock: The core processing unit. It takes the sequence and the global query, and through a gating network (comprising input_gate and forget_gate), it selectively updates each token's representation. This mechanism allows for efficient information propagation and filtering.

ZarvanForClassification: A higher-level model that wraps the core Zarvan components for classification tasks. It includes an embedding layer, positional encoding, a Zarvan block, and a final classification head (linear layer).

## Installation
This project requires PyTorch. You can install it via pip:

```Bash

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # For CUDA 11.8
# Or for CPU only:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
No other specific libraries are strictly required for the zarvan_model.py file itself, but training scripts might depend on tqdm, datasets, transformers, etc.
```
Usage
To use the Zarvan model in your project, you can import the classes from zarvan_model.py.

Example: Using ZarvanForClassification
The if __name__ == '__main__': block in zarvan_model.py provides a runnable example of how to instantiate and use the ZarvanForClassification model.

```Python

# In your Python script (e.g., my_training_script.py)
from zarvan_model import ZarvanForClassification
import torch

# Define model parameters
BATCH_SIZE = 4
SEQ_LEN = 512
VOCAB_SIZE = 10000
EMBED_DIM = 128
HIDDEN_DIM = 256
NUM_HEADS = 4
NUM_CLASSES = 5

# Initialize the model
model = ZarvanForClassification(
    vocab_size=VOCAB_SIZE,
    num_classes=NUM_CLASSES,
    seq_len=SEQ_LEN,
    embed_dim=EMBED_DIM,
    hidden_dim=HIDDEN_DIM,
    num_heads=NUM_HEADS
)

# Create dummy input (e.g., token IDs for a sequence)
dummy_input = torch.randint(low=1, high=VOCAB_SIZE, size=(BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN))

# Perform a forward pass
output_logits = model(dummy_input)

print(f"Output logits shape: {output_logits.shape}") # Expected: (BATCH_SIZE, NUM_CLASSES)
```
You can run the example directly from the command line:

```Bash

python zarvan_model.py
```
